# ![](Resources/VChatLogo-01.png) VeriChat
An open-source cross-platform 3D chatroom. No fee, no anti-cheat, no worries.<br />
Current version: 0.0.1 Alpha <br />
[中文版说明](README-CN.md)
## Introduction
VeriChat aims to provide a 3D chatroom where people can meet using their digital avatar, and the rooms and the avatars can be fully customized by any user. (So in short, it is pretty similar to VRChat)<br />
However, the software is completely open source and there will be no anti-cheat measure implemented (Seriously, why would anyone use a cheating software on a open world? There are only mod isn't it)<br />
The software is developed under unity 2021.3.0f1. To achieve better quality, URP is used in this project
